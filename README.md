##SimpleNeuralNetworks
This is intended to be a simple implementation of Artificial Neural Networks that I can easily include in other projects. It does not attempt to be fast or almighty, simplicity and few dependencies is more important.

This is partly for my own learning experience, so I do not expect it to be useful for anyone else.

####Dependencies
- C++11
- Eigen (header only template library)
